# Spectral Unmixing (SU) on Pavia University hyperspectral data set

#### For a given pixel in the image, the aim is to determine the percentage (abundance) to which each pure material contributes in its formation by adopting linear spectral unmixing hypothesis with below methods

* Least squares, 
* Least squares with sum-to-one constraint,
* Least squres with non-negativity constraint,
* Lasso
